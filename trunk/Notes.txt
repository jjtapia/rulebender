Use configurer.setSaveAndRestore() in the ApplicationWorkBenchAdvisor to save 
the location and size of all of the views, HOWEVER, this will prevent new 
views from being displayed during development.



	10 weeks to release:  
		Major tasks:
			1. Create grammar supported editor that can autocompile the code
			2. define dom for language (probably with existing perl datastructures)
			3. Finalize and implement dumb interface.
			4. construct CMap and IGraph with new datastructures.
			5. Fix overview window glitch with the prefuse supported solution.
			6. Manage links with RCP supported linking structures as necessary.
			   It is more important at first to just have the tool work.
			7. Implement simulation execution presenter classes.
			8. Implement user preferences.

			
			
			
			
			
Need a DS for all of the open files.  I will keep track of the models in a centralized DS, from which all translations/representations of the model will be computed.  
e.g.  Open file-> model is computed using antlr -> views will receive notification of file in view -> views access model and update content. file closed ->  model garbage collected.
result file opened -> result view made foremost.
