////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Number: 2

Description:
The user run a simulation on a model, and then the result viewer poped up automatically.

#2.1
Series of Actions:
(1) Run BNG Editor.

(2) Open a model file (BNGL).

(3) Press "Run" button on the tool bar or
	Open menu "Run" --> Select "Run Model"

Results: The running information showed in the "Console" region. And a new window "Viewer" poped up on the left-top corner. The first "GDAT" file in this simulation was opened automatically and all the checkboxes in front of the observables are checked. That means, all the curves of the observables showed in the chart.

#2.3
Series of Actions:
(1) Open a model file.

(2) Run one simulation on this model.

Results: The running information showed in the "Console" region. And a new window "Viewer" poped up on the left-top corner. The first "GDAT" file in this simulation was opened automatically and all the checkboxes in front of the observables are checked. That means, all the curves of the observables showed in the chart.

(3) Open another model file.

(4) Run one simulation on the second model.

Results: The running information showed in the "Console" region. And a new window "Viewer" poped up on the left-top corner. Each model has its own result viewer windows.

(5) Change the location and size of the second window.

(6) Run another simulation on the second model.

Results: The old "Viewer" will be closed. And a new "Viewer" will appear in the position of the old one and with the same size of the old one. The "Viewer" window for the first model stays the same.

(7) Open another "Viewer" from the menu "View" --> "Open Result Viewer".

Results: A new "Viewer" will appear in the left-top corner. Now there are three "Viewer" windows.

(8) Run another simulation on the second model.

Results: The "Viewer" opened from menu will be closed. The old "Viewer" for second model will be closed. A new "Viewer" for the second model will appear in the position of the old one and with the same size of the old one. So now, two "Viewer" window left.


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Number: 3

Description:
Open a file from the "Explorer" region for the first time.

The layout of the result viewer window contains three region, "Explorer", "Outline", and the chart & text region. The region "Explorer" listed all the directories and files under the root directory. The region "Outline" listed species and observables for result files. And the chart & text region show the chart and text for different types of files.

#3.1
Series of Actions:

A tab with a chart of all the curves of observables appeared in the chart & text region. The default option is "Chart:line, X Axis:linear, Y Axis:linear".

"CDAT": All the species (format: id) are listed in the region of "Outline", and none of the checkboxes are checked. A tab with an empty chart appeared in the chart & text region. The default option is "Chart:line, X Axis:linear, Y Axis:linear".
