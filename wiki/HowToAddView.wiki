#summary How to add a simple empty view to RuleBender

= Introduction =

Adding a view to RuleBender is the first step to producing another visualization or swt widget that can be used by a modeler.  There are many other things that you need to add to a view in order for it to be useful, but this page will show you the basic first step.

== 1. Create the view in the plugin.xml document visual interface ==

Open plugin.xml and go to the "Extensions" tab.  This tree structure is a visual interface to the Extensions element of the plugin.xml text file, and is much easier to use than editing the xml itself.  Each element in this tree defines a point of the Eclipse RCP framework that can be extended.  Right now we are concerned with the extension org.eclipse.ui.views.  To add a view to the system, right click on the views element and navigate to "New->view".

This will create a new node in the tree for our new view.  When this node is selected, it shows the properties for the view on the right hand side of the form.
