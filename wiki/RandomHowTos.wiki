#summary How to do some common things.

=How To...=

== Change the text on the Status Line ==

{{{
IStatusLineManager statusline = getWindowConfigurer()
		.getActionBarConfigurer().getStatusLineManager();

statusline.setMessage(null, "Status line is ready");
}}}


== Write to a Console ==

The console is currently only visible in the simulate perspective, but you can easily write to it with a static method in the Console class.  Consoles are managed by name, and new ones are created for names that are not recognized. 

{{{
Console.displayOutput("<console name>","<message>");
}}}

==Access the views==
If a view needs to be updated from a different package then use the code below.  This somewhat violates the separation of concerns and should not be used as a shortcut for a feature, but it does work and can be useful for testing.
	
{{{	 
IViewReference[] views = PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getActivePage().getViewReferences();

for(IViewReference view : views)
{
	if(view.getView(true) instanceof ContactMapView)
	{
		// ((ContactMapView)view.getView(true)).<whatever>();
	}
	
	else if(view.getView(true) instanceof InfluenceGraphView)
	{
		// ((InfluenceGraphView) view.getView(true)).<whatever>();
	}
}
}}}
