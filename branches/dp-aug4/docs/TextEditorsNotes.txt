Documentation for creating text editors with jface.  

TextEditor subclasses need DocumentProvider objecst (that can use partitioners) and can optionally have configurers. 

Partitioners separate the file into non-overlapping sections using ITokens and IRules. 

Configureres add color, annotation, etc to text with rules for each partition.  

See this for examples ->  http://www.realsolve.co.uk/site/tech/jface-text.php
